# Real-time-face-mask-detection


 This repository contains python code to detect faces with or without masks.

 Concept of DeepNeuralNetworks is used to prepare the model to detect the faces with or without masks. 
 OpenCV is used to detect faces in real-time using the Video Stream from the WebCam.
